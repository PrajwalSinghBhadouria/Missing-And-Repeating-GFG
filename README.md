Given an unsorted array arr of of positive integers. One number 'A' from set {1, 2,....,N} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array. Find numbers A and B.

Examples

Input: n = 2 arr[] = [2, 2]
Output: 2 1
Explanation: Repeating number is 2 and smallest positive missing number is 1.
Input: n = 3 arr[] = [1, 3, 3] 
Output: 3 2
Explanation: Repeating number is 3 and smallest positive missing number is 2.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
2 ≤ n ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ n
